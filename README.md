# Digital-Design-Project-1-
This C++ code simulates a digital circuit. It takes three files as input:

Library file (.lib): Defines available gates (NOT, AND, OR, etc.) and their properties.
Circuit file (.cir): Describes the circuit structure (gates, connections, outputs).
Stimuli file (.stim): Specifies logic level changes applied to circuit inputs at specific times.
The code outputs a simulation file (.sim) that details the circuit's behavior based on the provided inputs and gate delays.

To use the application:

Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Place the compiled code, library file, circuit file, and stimuli file in the same directory.
Run the compiled code with the filenames of the circuit files as arguments.
